      <h2>Description</h2>
      <div class="section">
        <p>
          As convenient as a store-bought mix can be, every home cook needs a
          good buttermilk pancake recipe in their repertoire. Don't have a
          tried-and-true favorite yet? You're in luck!
        </p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <div class="section">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Flour: All-purpose flour contains gluten, which gives the buttermilk
            pancakes structure and pleasant chewiness.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sugar: Just three tablespoons ofwhite sugar should be enough to lend
            subtle sweetness. Remember, you'll be adding a lot more sugar if you
            top the pancakes with syrup or molasses!
          </li>
          <li>
            Leaveners: Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners (a
            substance that releases gas when mixed with other ingredients,
            causing the batter to rise to fluffy perfection).
          </li>
          <li>
            Salt: You definitely don't want to skip adding a small amount of
            salt — the buttermilk pancakes will taste bland without it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Buttermilk: Of course, you'll need buttermilk for buttermilk
            pancakes! This recipe calls for three whole cups.
          </li>
          <li>
            Milk: Wholemilk helps create the perfect batter consistency and cuts
            some of the buttermilk's acidity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Eggs: Three whole eggs add structure and rich flavor to the
            buttermilk pancakes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Butter: Melted butter lends flavor and keeps the pancakes nice and
            moist.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <div class="section">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Mix the dry ingredients: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking
            soda, and salt in a large bowl.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mix the wet ingredients: Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted
            butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry
            ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make the pancakes: Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients
            and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are
            just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook
            until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook
            until both sides are brown.
          </li>
